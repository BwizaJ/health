        <p>Lapaire Glasses is a Kenyan eyecare business founded by Swiss National, Jerome Lapaire in 2018. Lapaire, a lawyer by profession, started the company after realizing that access to eye care services was the main problem in Kenya, as consulting an eye specialist and getting eyeglasses required a lot of time and money that most people could not afford.
          With the name Lapaire meaning "a pair of" in French, Jerome set up a small team and launched Lapaire Glasses with the goal of providing free vision tests, quality eyeglasses, and top nutch customer service. The company quickly caught the attention of a venture capital fund, Saviu Ventures, and now operates 20 optical shops across Africa with over 150 employees, including eye professionals. With a goal to be the go-to eyewear brand in Africa, Lapaire is planning to open more clinucs in major cities before venturing into rural areas.
          The company is also planning to expand in countries where it already operates, starting with more locations in Kenya, Uganda, and West Africa. Lapaire is constantly innovating and spends time raising awareness about eyecare, eye problems and eyeglasses.

        <p>Eyecare in developing countries like Kenya is one of the underfunded health sectors, making it difficult and expensive to access treatment. However, private hospitals and clinics have stepped up to provide innovative solutions to meet the changing health demands and needs.
          During the COVID-19 pandemic, the eyesector in Kneya saw an increase in bussiness as people spent more time on screens while working from home. One of the companies revolutionizing eye care in Africa is the Panafrican Optician Lapaire Group. Its founder, Jerome Lapaire, a Swiss national and lawyer by profession, started the company in 2018 with a small team and an innovative concept of providing free vision tests, qyality and affordable eyeglasses, and top-notch customer service. With the support of venture capital fund, Saviu Ventures, Lapaire Glasses has now grown to 40 optical shops across Africa with over 200 employees and has carried out over 150,000 vision test.

        <p>The World Health Organisation reports that nearlty one billion people globally have a vission impairement that could have been prevented or addressed, and over 550 million people need glasses but only one percent wears them. In Kenya , the Ministry of Health estimates that 7.5 million people need interventions to prevent loss of vision. The most common eye defect in Kenya is myopia or short-sightedness. Jerome says that it is important for Kenyans to know the status of their eyes and that eyeglasses are more accessible and affordable form of eye care equipment.</p></div>
